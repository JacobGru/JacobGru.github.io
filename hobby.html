			<h1>My Hobby is Riding my Bike</h1>
			<h2>im going to show you a step by step tutorial of how to ride one</h2>
			<h3>Step 1: Get Comfortable With Your Bike</h3>

				<p>2. Practice getting on and off the bike.</p>
				<p>3. Sit on the seat and balance while keeping both feet on the ground.</p>

			<h3>Step 2: Learn to balance</h3>
				<p>1. Sit on the bike and push yourself forward with your feet like a scoot or glide.</p>
				<p>2. Lift your feet for a second or two while moving and feel how the bike balances.</p>
				<p>3. Try to glide/scoot longer each time and keep your eyes looking ahead, not at your feet.</p>

			<h3>Step 3: Add pedaling</h3>
				<p>1. Put one pedal in the 2 o’clock position or slightly horizontal/forward.</p>
				<p>2. Place your foot on that pedal, and push down hard to start moving.</p>
				<p>3. As the bike moves, put your other foot on the opposite pedal and keep pedaling smoothly
				and keep your body relaxed and eyes forward.</p>

			<h3>Step 4: Practice braking</h3>
				<p>1. Squeeze both brake levers gently and evenly to slow down.</p>
				<p>2. Avoid pulling only the front brake though it can make you tip forward.</p>
				<p>3. Practice stopping smoothly and putting one foot down when you stop.</p>

			<h3>Step 5: Practice turning</h3>
				<p>1. Start with wide, gentle turns.</p>
				<p>2. Lean slightly into the turn and do not use your whole body.</p>
				<p>3. Keep pedaling slowly and look where you want to go.</p>

			<h3>Step 6: Build confidence</h3>
				<p>1. Practice starting, stopping, turning, and riding in a straight line.</p>
				<p>2. Ride on small slopes or grass to improve balance and control.</p>
				<p>3. Gradually try new environment like bike paths and quiet roads.</p>

			<h3>Final Tips</h3>
				<p>-Do not rush, everyone learns at their own pace.</p>
				<p>-Keep your eyes ahead and your bike goes where you look.</p>
				<p>-Smile! Relaxing helps your balance more than you would think.</p>
